to run this program:

      1 - Run ```cmake .``` in the repo directory

      2 - Run ```make shell`` in the same repo directory

      3 - finally to excute the program run ```./shell```
      
      OPTIONAL:- to clean the project run ```make clean``` all while in the same repo directory

How the program works:

      1 - To exit the program type ```exit 0``` (0 is the status code returned from main)
      2 - To ask myShell to print something to terminal type ```echo <some word>``` 

*** The program operates as expected in a local environment; however, it encounters issues when deployed on GitHub Workspaces ***
